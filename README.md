# "Honey, I'm Home": Unity project files
 
This repository contains the project folder for the game "Honey, I'm Home" created in Unity, using an algorithm to procedurally generate narrative puzzles (SPHINX). 

The game was developed over the course of approximately four months, but since it was only linked with this repositary midway through completion, no all steps and changes are shown here. A lot of the other steps are very small changes that were made and many of them were not relevant to the final product. As the strating point for this project was another, and that code was used and modified, most of the general scripts are not mine. A lot of them may contain changes and I tried to keep track of them over time and somehow mark them, but not all of them are labeled as such. The most comprehensive way to check this, would probably be to compare the code in this project to that used in the original. 
Many of the changes made along the way were not as efficient or clean as they could have been and the code which is specific to feature which I wanted to include in "Honey, I'm Home", would need to be separated. 

Again, my sincere apologies for the lack of structure. As mentioned in the supporting material guideline, while I was attempting to "clean" the project folder, something went screwy and important scripts were removed from a number of game objects. The version here was uploaded prior to the crash and should be fully functional, it is just a little messier.
